Freedom Fuels Pty Ltd is an average place to work. ... Most of the employees don't like their jobs and because Freedom Fuels isn't a well enough established fuel station it is a boring place to work.		/tmp/screenshots/2019-08-08/google_Freedom Fuels-p2.png		Working at Freedom Fuels: Employee Reviews | Indeed.com	200	https://au.indeed.com/cmp/Freedom-Fuels/reviews	utf-8		"Pros fun small place Cons bad pay Was this review helpful?Yes No Report Share Facebook Twitter Copy link 2.0 Job Work/Life Balance ---|--- Salary/Benefits Job Security/Advancement Management Job Culture Easy laid back place to work.
Console Operator Current Employee Brisbane QLD August 2019 This place is an easy laid back place to work.
Work load is easy to handle.
Happy staff and enviroment to work around.
Although it is easy they managers whom worked for do not care about anyone but themselves.
Working as casual my hours are always being cut.
This makes you feel quiting and not want to work them in general.
If you don’t make mind being called at all hours and don’t have family this will be good Pros Working with people Cons Long hours and always on call Was this review helpful?Yes No Report Share Facebook Twitter Copy link 3.0 Job Work/Life Balance ---|--- Salary/Benefits Job Security/Advancement Management Job Culture Average place to work, very boring, casual employees are treated as nothing.
CUSTOMER SERVICE ATTENDANT Former Employee Brisbane QLD 23 January 2019 Freedom Fuels Pty Ltd is an average place to work.
The company has casual pool for casual workers which means that you are able to work at other stores to pick up more hours and cover more shifts.
Most causal employees receive three to five hour shifts so if you don't live close to the store it's probably not worth it.
The work environment is decent but can vary depending on what store you go to.
Most of the employees don't like their jobs and because Freedom Fuels isn't well enough established fuel station it is boring place to work.
You won't receive breaks because you are working there alone.
If you smoke cigarettes it's probably not good place for you to work considering it is fuel station and strict policies are in place about smoking on site.
There isn't any career development here.
All in all an average place to work.
You will have to deal with customers constantly complaining about fuel prices if they rise.
Pros Staff discount on fuel and the hourly pay Cons No breaks because you are working independently most of the time, boring place to work, hard for career progression.

What you don’t hear quite so often is that the stuff under the land is also apparently made of freedom as well.
That is, at least according to news release this week from the Department of Energy DoE Mark Menezes, the US undersecretary of energy, bestowed peculiar honorific on our continent’s natural resources, dubbing it “freedom gas” in release touting the DoE’s approval of increased exports of natural gas produced by Freeport LNG terminal off the coast of Texas.
“Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies diverse and affordable source of clean energy,” he said.
ryan cooper @ryanlcooper actual Trump admin quote: ""Increasing export capacity from the Freeport liquid natural gas project is critical to spreading freedom gas"" https://t.co/KgZdh3V2Mt May 29, 2019 The concept of “freedom gas” may seem amorphous, but it’s actually being measured down to the smallest unit.
“With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world,” said Steven Winberg.
Jay Inslee @JayInslee This has to be joke.
Remember freedom fries? https://t.co/ei9Idg613X May 29, 2019 It’s unclear if members of the Trump administration attempting to assign patriotic intentions to natural gas are aware of the silliness of the concept, but Rick Perry seems to believe in it.
“Seventy-five years after liberating Europe from Nazi Germany occupation, the United States is again delivering form of freedom to the European continent,” the energy secretary said earlier this month, according to EURACTV.
“And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.”

The Trinity Petroleum brand will remain, and it is intended there will be no changes to the Mobil brand in the foreseeable future.
For staff, the sale is “business as usual”. After 40 years with Mobil and Trinity Petroleum, owner Dean Pradal said he was excited about the future of the company under new ownership and that he expected that the business’ long history of community involvement in Far North Queensland would continue notwithstanding the change.
“I’d like to extend my personal and genuine appreciation to our customers and suppliers who have supported Trinity over many years they have contributed to Trinity’s growth and the company wouldn’t be where it is without their support”, Mr Pradal said.
“Handing over the reins of Trinity after 40 years has been hard decision but there comes point when we all need to take stock and give the company the stepping stone it needs to grow and expand.
It was important to me to find good fit for my staff, customers, local support and corporate image.
Freedom Fuels has key goals that are in line with Trinity’s, therefore making the choice an easy one.
Over the 40 years have watched Trinity grow from small one man, one truck operation to what it is today fully-fledged business employing over 176 staff, operating 18 retail sites through Northern Queensland and running 12 Road Tankers.
am proud of the Trinity team and what we have achieved over that time, and look forward to seeing the future growth of the company under the stewardship of Freedom Fuels and Idemitsu”. Mr Pradal announced that large portion of funds from the sale will be used to establish the Trinity Foundation, community-focused charity to support the Far North Queensland community.
More details about the Foundation will be announced at later date.
spokesman for Freedom Fuels said that” quality, well run businesses”, such as Trinity Petroleum, don’t come along every day and that the acquisition provided great opportunity to connect the existing business in the Southern part of the State through to the Far North, making it one of the largest Independent fuel companies in Queensland.
PW09032018 Editors Note: We wish Mr Pradel well and thank him for being subscriber and supporter of PetrolWorld on line services for the last 13 years.

Console Operator Current Employee Brisbane QLD August 2019 This place is an easy laid back place to work.
Work load is easy to handle.
Happy staff and enviroment to work around.
Although it is easy they managers whom worked for do not care about anyone but themselves.
Working as casual my hours are always being cut.
This makes you feel quiting and not want to work them in general.
If you don’t make mind being called at all hours and don’t have family this will be good Pros Working with people Cons Long hours and always on call Was this review helpful?Yes No Report Share Facebook Twitter Copy link 3.0 Job Work/Life Balance ---|--- Salary/Benefits Job Security/Advancement Management Job Culture Average place to work, very boring, casual employees are treated as nothing.
CUSTOMER SERVICE ATTENDANT Former Employee Brisbane QLD 23 January 2019 Freedom Fuels Pty Ltd is an average place to work.
The company has casual pool for casual workers which means that you are able to work at other stores to pick up more hours and cover more shifts.
Most causal employees receive three to five hour shifts so if you don't live close to the store it's probably not worth it.
The work environment is decent but can vary depending on what store you go to.
Most of the employees don't like their jobs and because Freedom Fuels isn't well enough established fuel station it is boring place to work.
You won't receive breaks because you are working there alone.
If you smoke cigarettes it's probably not good place for you to work considering it is fuel station and strict policies are in place about smoking on site.
There isn't any career development here.
All in all an average place to work.
You will have to deal with customers constantly complaining about fuel prices if they rise.
Pros Staff discount on fuel and the hourly pay Cons No breaks because you are working independently most of the time, boring place to work, hard for career progression.

Customer Service Attendant Current Employee Brisbane QLD 13 March 2016 Working for Freedom Fuels has generally been good experience other than that my shifts and hours keep changing quite dramatically.
Pros Good pay rates and working conditions Cons Shifts and hours are inconsistent Was this review helpful?Yes No Report Share Facebook Twitter Copy link 5.0 Job Work/Life Balance ---|--- Salary/Benefits Job Security/Advancement Management Job Culture Great company to work for with good company culture Business Development Manager Former Employee Brisbane, QLD 30 December 2015 Most days spent on the road calling on existing accounts and identifying potential new accounts.
Great support team in the office with very open management style.
